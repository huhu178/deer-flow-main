This is the web UI for [`DeerFlow`](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow).

## How to Install

DeerFlow Web UI uses `pnpm` as its package manager.
To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
cd web
pnpm install
```

## How to Run in Development Mode

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure the Python API service is running before starting the web UI.

Start the web UI development server:

```bash
cd web
pnpm dev
```

By default, the web UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

You can set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable if you're using a different host or location.

```ini
# .env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```
