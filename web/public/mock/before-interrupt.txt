Tangbao, also known as soup dumplings, are a beloved delicacy that originated in the Shanghai region of China. These delectable dumplings are renowned for their unique combination of a delicate wrapper and a savory soup filling. Tangbao is a staple in Chinese cuisine, boasting a rich history that dates back centuries.\\nThe name “tangbao” literally translates to “soup bun,” which perfectly encapsulates the essence of this dish. Unlike traditional dumplings, tangbao contains a flavorful broth along with the filling, creating a burst of flavor with every bite. The secret to the soup-filled center lies in the use of a gelatinous stock that solidifies when chilled. When the tangbao is steamed, the heat causes the broth to liquefy, resulting in a delicious and juicy filling.\\nAuthentic tangbao distinguishes itself with its delicate yet elastic wrapper. The wrapper should be thin enough to allow the flavors of the filling to shine through, while also being sturdy enough to hold the rich soup inside. Achieving the perfect wrapper texture requires skill and precision, as it must be neither too thick nor too thin.\\n\\nTraditional tangbao features a filling made from minced pork, which is marinated in a flavorful blend of soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and other seasonings. The tangy and aromatic filling adds depth and complexity to the overall taste. However, modern variations of tangbao may include other ingredients, such as chicken, seafood, or vegetarian options, catering to different dietary preferences.\\n\\nThese well-crafted dumplings have gained popularity not only in China but also worldwide. Experience the authentic tangbao and indulge in the harmonious combination of rich broth, tantalizing filling, and delicate wrapper.\\nTangbao Filling: A Burst of Flavor\\nOne of the most crucial components of a tangbao is its flavorful filling. The combination of well-marinated pork and aromatic seasonings creates a burst of flavor with every bite. In this section, we will guide you through the process of preparing a delicious tangbao filling that will elevate the taste of your soup dumplings.\\nLet’s start by selecting the right cut of pork for the filling. Choose fatty cuts, such as pork shoulder or pork belly, as they will add moisture and tenderness to the filling. Take care to remove any excess fat to ensure a balanced texture.\\nNext, it’s time to marinate the pork. A traditional tangbao filling is typically seasoned with a combination of soy sauce, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, and Shaoxing wine. This marinade not only enhances the flavor of the pork but also helps tenderize it. You can adjust the quantities of these ingredients to suit your taste preferences, but be careful not to overpower the natural flavors of the meat.\\n| Ingredients | Quantity |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Pork (shoulder or belly) | 1 lb (450g) |\\n| Soy sauce | 2 tablespoons |\\n| Ginger (minced) | 1 tablespoon |\\n| Garlic (minced) | 1 tablespoon |\\n| Sesame oil | 1 tablespoon |\\n| Shaoxing wine | 1 tablespoon |\\nAfter marinating the pork for at least 30 minutes, it’s time to prepare the filling. Finely chop the marinated pork into small pieces. This will ensure a cohesive texture and even distribution of flavors throughout the tangbao.\\nWhile preparing the filling, it’s essential to strike the right balance between moisture and binding. You can achieve this by adding a small amount of chicken stock, cornstarch, or gelatin to the filling mixture. This will help create a juicy and cohesive filling that doesn’t leak out during the cooking process.\\nTo add depth to the flavors, some recipes include additional ingredients such as green onions, mushrooms, or cabbage. These ingredients not only provide a burst of freshness but also add texture to the filling. Feel free to experiment with different variations and find the combination that best suits your palate.\\n\\nPro Tips: To enhance the umami flavor of the filling, consider adding some dried shrimp or dried scallops. These ingredients are often used in traditional Chinese recipes and can take your tangbao filling to the next level.\\n\\nOnce the tangbao filling is ready, it’s time to move on to the next step of the recipe. In the following section, we will learn how to create the perfect tangbao wrapper, ensuring that it’s both thin and sturdy enough to hold the flavorful soup inside.\\nCreating the Perfect Tangbao Wrapper\\nOne of the most crucial components of a delicious tangbao is the wrapper. It not only holds the aromatic soup and filling together but also provides a delicate texture that complements the flavors. Master the art of making tangbao wrappers with our step-by-step instructions and achieve the perfect texture and elasticity.\\nTo create the ideal tangbao wrapper, follow these key steps:\\n\\nPrepare the dough: Start by combining all-purpose flour, water, and a pinch of salt in a mixing bowl. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and pliable. Let it rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax and make rolling easier.\\nRoll out the dough: Divide the dough into small portions and roll each piece into a thin circle. Dust your work surface and rolling pin with flour to prevent sticking. Aim for a thickness of approximately 2-3 millimeters.\\nShape the wrappers: Use a round cookie cutter or a small bowl to cut out uniform circles from the rolled dough. Each wrapper should be around 7-8 centimeters in diameter.\\nMaintain the thickness: Ensure that the edges of the wrapper are slightly thicker than the center. This will help prevent any leakage of the soup while steaming.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can achieve tangbao wrappers that are thin, yet sturdy enough to hold the flavorful soup inside. The elasticity of the wrapper ensures that it perfectly encases the filling and creates a delightful texture when you take a bite.\\n\\n“The tangbao wrapper is like a delicate embrace that contains the essence of the soup and enhances the overall dumpling experience.”\\n\\nMastering the Tangbao Steaming Process\\nSteaming tangbao is a crucial step in achieving the perfect texture and taste. With the right steaming time and techniques, you’ll be able to enjoy tangbao that are cooked to perfection, with a juicy soup filling that bursts with flavor.\\nHere are some key tips to help you master the tangbao steaming process:\\n\\nPreparation: Before steaming, make sure your tangbao are placed securely in a steamer basket lined with parchment paper or cabbage leaves. This will prevent them from sticking to the steamer and tearing apart during cooking.\\nWater Level: Fill the steamer pot with water, making sure the water level is below the steamer basket. Too much water can cause the tangbao to become soggy, while too little water may result in uneven cooking.\\nSteaming Time: The steaming time for tangbao will vary depending on their size and thickness. As a general guideline, steam small tangbao for about 8-10 minutes, medium-sized ones for 10-12 minutes, and larger tangbao for 12-15 minutes. It’s important to check for doneness by gently pressing the tangbao wrapper. If it springs back, they are cooked through.\\nTemperature Control: Maintain a consistent steam temperature throughout the cooking process. Avoid lifting the lid frequently, as this can cause fluctuations in the steam temperature. Steaming tangbao requires patience, so resist the temptation to peek too often.\\n\\nFollowing these tips will ensure that your tangbao are properly cooked, with a tender wrapper and a piping hot, flavorful soup filling. The steaming process allows the wrapper to absorb the steam and become translucent, while the filling turns into a rich, savory broth that complements the tasste. Experience the authentic taste of tangbao that melts in your mouth with every bite.\\n\\n“Steaming tangbao is like unlocking a treasure trove of flavors. The steam gently cooks the dumplings, resulting in a delicate wrapper that holds a burst of aromatic soup inside.”\\n\\nNow that you’ve learned the art of mastering the tangbao steaming process, let’s explore the final step – assembling and folding tangbao to create the iconic shape.\\n| Tangbao Steaming Tips | Steaming Time (minutes) |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Small Tangbao | 8-10 |\\n| Medium Tangbao | 10-12 |\\n| Large Tangbao | 12-15 |\\n\\nContinue your tangbao journey and discover how to assemble and fold tangbao to achieve the iconic pleated dumpling shape in the next section.\\nAssembling and Folding Tangbao\\nNow comes the exciting part – assembling and folding the tangbao!

It is said that it was first created in Kaifeng, Henan, during Song dynasty. There are many varieties throughout China, xiaolongbao being one of them. They will vary in size, from small to very large ones, and in the fillings, with the most typical ones being pork, crab roe, crab and pork filling. They are steamed and served with a dipping sauce that needs to have some acidity to cut through the greasiness and oiliness. Traditionally, large ones should be consumed by biting into them first, then letting the soup come out and slurping it up and eating them up, as that way there's is less danger from burning one's mouth with the hot soup. The smaller ones are eaten much the same way, except they are usually dipped into the sauce and not drizzled with it.\\nMain ingredients\\n\\n Wheat Flour\\n Ground Pork\\nOR Crab\\n Gelatin\\n Garlic\\n Ginger\\n Scallions\\n Soy sauce\\n Sesame Oil\\n Shaoxing wine\\n Sugar\\n Salt\\n\\nCooking tips\\n\\n\\nwrappers\\nUnlike other kinds of dumpling wrappers which can be store-bought, the wrappers for tangbao should be made from scratch, since store-bought ones simply are not elastic enough to hold the liquid filling.

Also, using aromatics like ginger, green onions and sometimes cooking wine is also a must. Although meat jelly is ...

Chinese spoon and chopstick can also come in handy. You can surely purchase these in Asian stores, if necessary or order those online.\\n\\n\\nhow to eat tangbao (soup dumplings)\\nPick the dumpling carefully with chopsticks and dip it into the dipping sauce, then place it in a duck spoon — you can use a small bowl instead. Next, pinch open the dumpling and allow the soup to pour out. Carefully slurp the hot soup, then eat the dumpling in one go. Additionally, you can add the sauce to the spoon or to the dumpling for a more intense flavor. Big soup dumplings are typically eaten ...

The recipe makes two large soup dumplings, and instructions for the dipping sauce are also included in the recipe. You'll start by preparing an aspic, a gelatinous pork broth that's the secret to the dumpling's soup-like interior and which needs to rest for 24 hours to solidify. The dough is made the following day, as is the filling, which needs to have a paste-like consistency, and the dumplings are then assembled and, ideally, should be steamed in individual bamboo baskets.

It is named after Nanjing’s historical moniker, “Jinling,” which means “capital of Jin.” Although Jinling roast duck is not as famous around the world as Pecking roast duck in Beijing, its taste and scrumptiousness are just as exceptional.\\n\\nSimilar to other roast duck dishes, Jinling roast duck involves a meticulous preparation process. The duck is first cleaned and dressed, and then it is marinated with a combination of various seasonings and spices. The marinade typically includes soy sauce, ginger, garlic, sugar, and other aromatic ingredients. The duck is left to absorb the flavors for a specific period, ensuring a rich and well-seasoned taste.\\n\\nAfter the preparation process, the duck is traditionally roasted in a closed oven using fruit tree wood as fuel.

The vermicelli noodles, duck meat, tofu, mushrooms, and other ingredients are also cooked in the broth until they are tender and infused with the soup’s flavors.\\n\\nDuck blood vermicelli soup has a rich and savory flavor.

The mixture is then spooned onto a dumpling wrapper, folded into a pleated shape, and topped with a small piece of shrimp.\\n\\nOnce assembled, the egg shaomai are traditionally steamed in bamboo steamers, allowing them to cook gently and retain their moisture. The steaming process ensures that the dumpling wrappers become soft and translucent while the filling is cooked to perfection.\\n\\nEgg shaomai has a delightful combination of flavors. The filling is savory and rich, with the umami taste of the pork and shrimp complemented by the earthiness of mushrooms and the aroma of seasonings. The addition of the egg provides a silky and creamy texture to the filling, enhancing its overall taste.\\n\\nEgg shaomai is typically served in bamboo steamers, with each steamer holding several pieces of shaomai. It is often enjoyed as a snack or as part of a dim sum meal.

The broth is made by simmering ingredients such as dried shiitake mushrooms, bamboo shoots, dried shrimp, or chicken bones to extract their flavors.\\n\\nTo make Gansi tofu, the tofu is first cut into small cubes or slices. The broth is prepared separately by simmering the ingredients in water to create a fragrant and flavorful base. The tofu is then gently added to the broth to heat through without breaking apart. The broth provides a savory and aromatic base, while the tofu absorbs the flavors of the broth, adding a creamy and delicate taste to the dish. The combination of the two creates a comforting and satisfying experience.\\n\\nGansi tofu is typically served in a small bowl or individual soup bowls. The tofu cubes are immersed in the broth, and the dish is garnished with chopped green onions or cilantro for added freshness and visual appeal. It can be enjoyed on its own or served alongside other dishes as part of a larger meal. It pairs well with steamed rice, as the rice can be mixed with the broth to create a flavorful combination. Some people also enjoy adding soy sauce, vinegar, or chili oil to enhance the taste.\\n\\nGansi tofu is commonly found in local eateries, traditional restaurants, and even street food stalls in Nanjing. You can enjoy this dish at Nanjing Impressions at No. 2, Shiziqiao, Gulou District for 3.5 USD per bowl.\\n\\nMandarin Sweet and Sour Fish\\n\\nMandarin-style sweet and sour fish, also known as “Tang Cu Yu” in Chinese, is a regional variation of the classic Chinese sweet and sour fish dish. It reflects the culinary style and flavor preferences of the Mandarin cuisine, which is prevalent in the northern regions of China, including Nanjing.\\n\\nThe fish is typically marinated with salt, pepper, and sometimes Shaoxing wine or rice wine for added flavor. It is then coated with cornstarch or a batter made from a combination of flour and cornstarch and deep-fried until golden and crispy. The sauce is prepared separately by combining vinegar, sugar, ketchup, soy sauce, and other seasonings in a wok or saucepan.\\n\\nMandarin sweet and sour fish emphasizes a balance of sweet and sour flavors. The sauce has a tangy and slightly sweet taste, with a hint of saltiness from the soy sauce. Nanjing-style sweet and sour fish often leans towards a slightly sweeter profile compared to other regional variations. The crispy fried fish provides a delightful contrast to the sauce, offering a combination of textures.\\n\\nMandarin sweet and sour fish in Nanjing is typically served hot and garnished with sliced green onions or cilantro for freshness and visual appeal. It is often presented on a large plate or a serving platter, allowing the vibrant fish and sauce to be showcased. This dish is definitely suitable for a warm family meal. So, give it a try when you visit Nanjing!\\n\\nFreshwater Crabs\\n\\nFreshwater crabs, also known as “Nan Jing Da Zha Xie” in Chinese, refer to crabs that are harvested from the rivers, lakes, and fields around Nanjing. They are known for their delicate flavor, tender meat, and unique characteristics specific to the region.\\n\\nFreshwater crabs are often prepared by steaming or boiling to preserve their natural flavors. Before cooking, the crabs are cleaned and seasoned. They are then cooked until their shells turn a vibrant orange-red color. The crabs are typically served whole, and the meat is enjoyed by cracking the shell and extracting it using specialized crab utensils.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are various ways to enjoy freshwater crabs in Nanjing. Some popular dishes include steamed whole crabs, crab roe xiaolongbao (steamed soup dumplings), crab meat-filled dumplings, stir-fried crab with ginger and scallions, and crab meat fried rice. These dishes showcase the natural sweetness and unique characteristics of the crabs.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere to try freshwater crabs in Nanjing?\\n\\nGao You Seafood Street: Located in the Gaochun District of Nanjing, this street is lined with seafood restaurants specializing in freshwater field crab dishes. It’s a popular destination for locals and visitors alike.\\n\\nNanjing Hexi Crab Market: This market is dedicated to freshwater field crabs and offers a vibrant atmosphere where you can select live crabs and have them prepared on-site at the market’s restaurants.\\n\\nOf course, there are more options of food when it comes to Nanjing cuisine, but we hope those top specialties of the place will satisfy your food adventure on your next visit to Nanjing.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome best day tours, trips, activities and transfer services, tickets in, from and to Nanjing you can refer to\\n\\n\\n\\nRead more China guide here and Nanjing guide here.\\n\\nRelated articles\\n\\nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\\n\\n15+ top attractions & best places to visit in Nagoya\\n\\nIbaraki travel blog: The fullest Ibaraki travel guide for first-timers\\n\\n19+ most famous dishes & must try foods in France that will impress foodies\\n\\nMont Saint-Michel blog: The ultimate Mont Saint-Michel travel guide for first-timers\\n\\nWhat to eat in Malaysia? — 10+ most famous, best dishes & must try food in Malaysia\\n\\nThe ultimate Pratunam market guide: Experience a shopping paradise in Bangkok\\n\\nWhere to go in Taichung? — 16+ must-go & best places to visit in Taichung\\n\\n22+ top tourist attractions & must see places in Osaka\\n\\n20+ must-go places & best places to visit in Osaka\\n\\nEDITOR PICKS\\n\\n15+ top attractions & best places to visit in Nagoya\\n\\nIbaraki travel blog: The fullest Ibaraki travel guide for first-timers\\n\\n19+ most famous dishes & must try foods in France that...\\n\\nPOPULAR POSTS\\n\\nWhat to buy in USA? — 17+ must buy in USA...\\n\\nWhat to buy in Korea? — Top +23 cheap, famous &...\\n\\nMust buy souvenir in Taiwan — Top 17+ most famous, cheap...\\n\\nPOPULAR CATEGORY\\n\\n\"}, {\"type\": \"page\", \"title\": \"Top 10 Nanjing Food You Must Try - Trip.com\", \"url\": \"https://www.trip.com/guide/food/nanjing-food.html\", \"content\": \"Zhiwei Guan (知味观): A Nanjing institution, Zhiwei Guan serves delicious Tang Bao, with a signature blend of soup and juicy pork filling.

The \\\"macro-tourism\\\"\\ntheoretical system initially proposed in the paper gives those cities that are similar to Nanjing in the strength and growth\\nstage of the tourist industry some reference in their tourism growth.\\nKeywords: Macro-tourism, Industry theory, Strategy\\n1. Introduction\\n1.1 Origin and Connotations of “Macro-tourism” Concept\\nIn 1995, the strategic vision of developing macro-tourism was first brought forward by Nanjing Municipal Government\\namong the capital cities of deputy provincial level across the country(Luo Zhijun 2001).The following year saw the\\nsubmission of the research report entitled The Macro-tourism Development in the New Century by the Topic\\nGroup(Topic Group 1996).\\nThere are various opinions about the concept of macro-tourism, though, gradually a certain consensus has been reached.\\nThe author summarizes the opinions as follows:\\nThe so-called macro-tourism, is a concept beyond the tourism itself. That is, a breakthrough to the traditionally narrow\\nand closed concept of tourism. With this concept, tourism is understood as a subsystem under the macro system of local\\nsocio-economic development and the benign interaction between the tourist industry as a subsystem and the\\nsocio-economic development as a macroeconomic system is emphasized. The concept contains the following meanings:\\n1. First of all, the independent industrial status of tourism is recognized, but more emphasis is put on the in-depth\\npotential tapping and integration of the six elements within the value chain of tourism, namely, food, housing,\\ntransportation, travel, shopping, and entertainment. 2. More emphasis is put on the convergence and integration of\\ntourism and other local industries while the independent industrial status of tourism is acknowledged. In other words,\\nthe comprehensiveness, relevance and drive of the tourism is emphasized. 3. With the concept of macro-tourism, we\\ngive priority to the comprehensive benefits of tourism in promoting the local social and economic development, i.e. we\\nnot only pay attention to the economic benefits of tourism itself but value the social and ecological benefits of tourism\\nin improving the local city image, the investment environment, business attraction, employment, environment\\nbeautification and other aspects (Qiao Li and Li Maomin, 2000). It is indeed a concept originated from the local region.\\nSuch concepts as ecological tourism or sustainable tourism are introduced from the international tourism theories.\\nHowever, the concept of macro-tourism emerged in a local background of relatively mature tourism with a history of 30\\nyears.\\nTo sum up, the author thinks the concept of \\\"macro-tourism\\\" can be defined as follows: it is a new concept created in\\nthe context that China’s tourist industry grows relatively mature. First, it is an integrated industrial system made up of\\nthe leading industry of big tourism formed by the six elements of tourist industry, the auxiliary industries directly or\\nindirectly related to the macro-tourism, and the associated industries related to core tourism due to the economic and\\ntechnical ties. It is also a cluster of industries formed when the tourism industry chain deepens and widens due to the\\ncontinuous inward and outward expansion of tourist industry value chain. A prevailing view is that the tourist industry\\nconsists of 58 related industries. See figure 1 for the structure and function of the macro-tourism industrial system.\\nSecondary, it is a mode of tourist industry development mode with focus on the openness, interaction and integrationVol. 4, No. 9 International Journal of Business and Management\\n156\\nbetween the tourist industry and the related industries for the maximum overall benefits of the whole macro-tourism\\nindustrial system as well as the coordinated development of the social-economic-ecological macro-system.\\nInsert Figure 1 here\\nIt is easy to see from the above figure that the macro-tourism industrial structure is featured by objective, overall,\\nhierarchical and dynamic nature. To put it in simple words, the authors holds that “macro-tourism” is reflected by the\\nlarge scale and scope of the tourist industry system as well as its multiple benefits and regional cooperation.\\nThe macro-tourism concept is different from the traditional tourism concept in its new outlook toward resources, market\\nand development.\\nFirst of all, the concept of macro-tourism replaces the tourism resources outlook in the traditional tourism concept with\\nthe theory of “Tourist Attraction”, which ensures the comprehensiveness of tourism. In the traditional tourism concept,\\nwhat attracts the tourists in the tourism destination are natural and human tourism resources. However, in the concept of\\nmacro-tourism, any visible or invisible element that attracts tourists can be regarded as the tourism resources in a broad\\nsense. Such progress in the concept broadens the industrial components of the tourism as well as lays a theoretical\\nfoundation for the tourism to give a full play to its soft strength. For instance, Singapore takes pride in its ability to\\nresolve the housing of its citizens on a tiny land and therefore shows the domestic and overseas tourists its achievements\\nin housing construction as a tourism resource. Coincidentally, the activity of “Millions of citizens tour around Nanjing\\\"\\norganized by the Propaganda Department of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee has the similar effect.\\nSecondary, the concept of macro-tourism contains the market outlook that the traditional tourism concept is void of.\\nIn the traditional tourism concept, the real tourists refer to those leaving their residence to spend the night elsewhere\\nwith motive to travel and strong capacity to pay the expense; while in the macro-tourism concept, anyone with motive\\nto travel is a tourist regardless of the expense and whether to stay overnight elsewhere or not. For example, the trip rate\\nfor the urban residents in Jiangsu Province was 164.58% in 2005 and that for Nanjing residents was above the average\\nrate with the number of trips 62,000,000 person times. The data are obviously obtained through the statistics according\\nto the macro-tourism concept.\\nThirdly, the development outlook of comprehensive benefits contained in the macro-tourism concept ensures the\\nmultiple benefits. In the traditional tourism concept, the pursuit of maximum self economic benefits is taken as the\\nmajor target and the linkage effect between the social benefits and industrial chains of tourism tends to be neglected.\\nHowever, in the concept of macro-tourism, tourism is nothing but the subsystem of national economy with linkage.\\nTherefore, the focus is put on the self economic benefits as well as its leading function on other industries. It is\\ncalculated that the income of per 1 US dollar in the foreign tourism may add 2.5 US dollars to GDP; while in China, the\\nsame income may add 3.12 US dollars to GDP and add 5.9 US dollars to the FDI.\\n1.2 The Effect of Macro-tourism Industry\\nFrom the standpoint of GDP statistics, the macro-tourism has greater potential than the traditional tourism in promoting\\nthe growth of national economy (Xu Lin and Dong Suocheng 2007) benefits of tourism were reflected by directly\\nadding the economic income of the departments and units engaged in tourism without taking the drive and relevance of\\ntourism into account.\\nFrom the perspective of industry, the macro-tourism has multiple influences on national economy and thus applies\\nstronger impact on GDP. First, take the travel services provided by the domestic tourism enterprises as consumption (C)\\nwhich influences the added value of consumption in GDP accounting; Secondly, take the expenditures on the buildings,\\nfacilities and equipment that the travel services are rely on as investment (I) which influences the added value of\\ninvestment in GDP accounting; Again, the travel consumption by the outbound tourists is taken as imports (M), which\\ninfluences the added value of imports in the GDP accounting; The relevant travel services the domestic tourism\\nenterprises provide to the inbound tourists are taken as exports (X), which influences the added value of exports in the\\nGDP accounting. GDP is calculated in the following equation: GDP = C + I + X – M. Therefore, the macro-tourism has\\na greater potential in promoting the growth of national economy.\\nCompared with the traditional tourism, the macro-tourism industry system has a higher relevance and stronger drive.\\nThe research data suggest that China's international tourism income multiplier is between 3.56 and 4.97, the correlation\\ncoefficient between the international tourism income and the third industry is 0.978, that between the international\\ninbound tourism and export trade is 0.977; and that between the international inbound tourism and investment attraction\\nis 0.943. The above data suggest that due to the development of macro-tourism, the tourism will surely have a stronger\\nimpact on other industries and the local social economic development.\\nCompared with the traditional tourism, the macro-tourism industry system may create more employment opportunities.\\nAs a typical labor-intensive industry, tourism is made one of the industries with the strongest drive to employment due\\nto its strong employment multiplier effect.International Journal of Business and Management September, 2009\\n157\\nIn the project of tourism employment research jointly organized and completed by the National Development and\\nReform Commission and China National Tourism Administration, tourism employment is classified into “employment\\nin tourism core industry”, “employment in Industry with tourism feature”, and “employment in tourism economy”.\\nAmong them, “employment in tourism core industry” refers to the number of direct employment in tourism released in\\nChina’s tourism statistics; “employment in industry with tourism feature” means the employment in the industries\\nrelated to tourism. In fact, the contribution of tourism to the employment in the relevant industries accounts for over\\n10%; “employment in tourism economy” is defined in line with the definition of UNWTO, referring to the employment\\nin the macro-tourism industry composed of tourism and the directly or indirectly related industries. The statistical result\\nshows that the multiplier coefficient between the employment in industry with tourism features and in tourism economy\\nis 1:3 while that between the employment in the tourism core industry and tourism economy is 1:8.\\nCompared with the traditional tourism, the macro-tourism industry system more likely gives birth to new tourism\\nformat which may become a new economic growth point in promoting the tourism economic development.\\nThere exists coordination and innovation effect among the industrial units within the macro-tourism. The 14 industrial\\nand agricultural tourism model areas of state level are the fruit of industrial integration. The agricultural and industrial\\ntourism become the new economic growth points promoting the development of tourism in Nanjing. According to the\\nstatistics of the authorities in charge of tourism, in 2007 the five suburban zones and counties – Jiangning, Lishui,\\nGaochun, Pukou and Luhe received tourists totaled 5,470,000 person times and the total income of tourism reached\\nCNY 6 billion accounting for 9.8% of the total income of tourism across Nanjing for the first time. The fast-growing\\ntourism economy in suburban zones and counties plays an important role in the rapid development of tourism in\\nNanjing.\\n2. Theoretical Foundation for Macro-tourism Industry\\n2.1 The Theory of Industrial Life Cycle\\nThe industrial life cycle refers to the whole period when the industry of certain type emerged till completely retreated\\nfrom the social economic activities. The industrial life cycle mainly includes four phases: naive period, growing period,\\nmaturity period and declining period. The main indexes to recognize the phase of industrial life cycle are: market\\ngrowth rate, demand growth rate, product varieties, number of competitors, entry to and exit from barriers,\\ntechnological renovation and user purchase etc.\\nThe author thinks that as Nanjing tourist industry is at the growing period and its basic task is to further strengthen itself,\\nit is objective and necessary to change the growth mode of Nanjing tourism economy and realize the upgrading of\\ntourist industry by choosing the macro-tourism model to integrate the endogenous and exogenous variables.\\nThe author’s judgment about the life cycle of Nanjing tourist industry is mainly based on the following three points.\\nFirst, recent years have seen the continuous fast growing of Nanjing tourist industry. The total tourism income in\\nNanjing increased to CNY 46.28 billion in 2006 from CNY 22.04 billion in 2002 with an average growth rate of 20%,\\nranking the fourth place for consecutive 4 years among the 15 cities of deputy provincial level across the country. The\\nforeign exchange earnings from international tourism was up to US$ 677 million in 2006 from US$ 323 million in 2002\\nwith an average increase of 20.3%. The number of domestic tourists to Nanjing rose from 20,760,000 person times in\\n2002 to 38,000,000 person times in 2006, increasing at an average rate of 16.3% while the number of overseas tourists\\nto Nanjing went up from 56,130,000 person times in 2002 to 100,920,000 person times in 2006, increasing at an\\naverage rate of 15.8% per year.\\nSecond, there is no sign of growth limit for Nanjing tourist industry even thought it maintains high-speed growth. There\\nwas still a good tendency of fast development for Nanjing tourist industry in 2007. In 2007, the income from tourism\\nwas totaled CNY 61.49 billion, up by 25.2% over the same period of the previous year. The earnings of foreign\\nexchange from tourism were US$ 808 million with year-on-year growth of 19.3%. Nanjing received the domestic and\\noverseas tourists totaling 46,051,200 person times, increasing by 18.1% over the same period of the previous year. The\\nnumber of the overseas tourists totaled 1,161,200 person times and that of the domestic tourists 44,890,000 person times,\\nup by 15.1% and 18.1% respectively. Moreover, Nanjing tourist industry plans to achieve the total tourism income of\\nCNY 100 billion by the year 2010.\\nThird, there is a large stock in the Nanjing tourist industry without reduction in growth rate. Up to the end of 2007, there\\nwere 436 travel agencies in Nanjing, an increase of 26 over the end of the previous year. There were 143 tourism-star\\nhotels, up by 6; 31 four-star and five-star hotels, up by 9. 35 scenic spots of A level, increasing by 7 as against the end\\nof the previous year. There were 14 industrial and agriculture model areas of the national level.\\n2.2 Proliferation Effect Theory of Leading Industry\\nU.S. development economist Rostow believes that no matter what the period is, even in a mature and growing economic\\nsystem, economic growth remains as a result of the rapid expansion of the few leading departments, and such anVol. 4, No. 9 International Journal of Business and Management\\n158\\nexpansion also exerts a significant influence on other industries, that is the proliferation effect of leading industry,\\nincluding recalling effect, flanking effect and forward effect. This is known as the Rostow Proliferation effect theory of\\nleading industry.\\nIn 2007, the total income from Nanjing tourism accounted for 18.78% of GDP and 38.82% of the added value of the\\nthird industry. From these two data we can easily come to the conclusion that Nanjing tourism, as a pillar industry, is\\ntaking the lead in the third industry. What’s more, we may conclude that Nanjing tourist industry is equipped with the\\ncharacteristics of leading industry through the further analysis of the proliferation effect.\\nThe forward effect of Nanjing tourism refers to that the leading industry can evoke new economic activities or derive\\nnew industrial departments and may even establish new platform for the next important leading industry. The\\ndevelopment of Nanjing tourism directly promotes the growth of the local transportation, hotels, scenic spots, retail\\nstores, entertainment, exhibition, real estate and other industries.\\nThe recalling effect of Nanjing tourism refers to that the high-speed growth of leading industry creates new demand for\\ninvestment in various elements and thus stimulates the development of these industries. The development of Nanjing\\ntourism stimulates the investment from the construction industry, post and telecommunications communications\\nindustry, finance and insurance industry, automobile manufacturing, culture and education industry to tourist industry.\\nThe flanking effect of Nanjing tourism refers to that the rise of the leading industry will influence the local social and\\neconomic development. The development of Nanjing tourist industry promotes a new-round city construction and the\\ntangible and intangible cultural heritage protection. Meanwhile, it plays a positive role in displaying the city image of\\nNanjing, optimizing the investment environment and promoting the environment protection.\\nThe comprehensive, open and interactive tourist industry of Nanjing coincides with the proliferation effect of leading\\nindustry. This, again proves that the concept of macro-tourism is scientific and feasible.\\n2.3 Symbiosis Theory\\nThe term Symbiosis was first originated from biology and presented by Germany mycologist Anton de Bary in 1879,\\nmeaning “Creatures of different species live together linked by some substance.” After 1950s, the symbiosis theory has\\nbeen applied to many fields of social study. In general sense, symbiosis refers to the relation formed between the\\nsymbiotic units in some symbiotic mode in a certain symbiotic environment. It consists of three elements, namely,\\nsymbiotic unit, mode and environment. Among them, symbiotic unit refers to the basic energy production and exchange\\nunit of symbiosis, i.e. the basic material condition to form the symbiosis. The symbiotic environment refers to the\\nexterior conditions for the existence and development of symbiosis.\\nThe industry of macro-tourism meets the requirements of symbiosis theory for three elements. The tourist industry and\\nthe relevant 58 industries constitute the symbiotic unit. There are various interaction between the symbiotic units\\ncontained in the industry of comprehensive tourist in a certain socio-economic context, which means the existence of\\nsymbiotic model.\\nAccording to the symbiosis theory, there exists self-organization process between the units of the macro-tourism\\nindustry as well as the individuality of symbiotic process which is demonstrated as the coordination and even\\ninnovation among the units of each industry. That is to say, according to the symbiosis theory, the macro-tourism is not\\nmerely the simple sum of the units of each industry. Instead, there exists the coordination effect of “1+1>2” and it is\\npossible to create new industries through the integration of existing industries.\\n3. The Symbiosis Model within the Macro-tourism Industry\\nThe ideal symbiosis model in the industry of macro-tourism is the combination of symmetrical mutually-beneficial\\nsymbiotic model with the integrated symbiotic organizational model.\\nWithin the industry of macro-tourism, each industry maintains association by means of products, labor, technique,\\nemployment and investment with tourism as the center, which is the basis for the existence of the industry of\\nmacro-tourism. However, those concepts used to express the industrial association in the traditional industrial economy\\nlike forward association and backward association, one-way association and round-way association, direct association\\nand indirect association can only explain the internal association of the macro-tourism industry in superficial level.\\nMoreover, we analyze the industrial association of macro-tourism to promote the development of macro-tourism\\nthrough the understanding of its internal logic structure. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the ways of industrial\\nassociation of macro-tourism by implanting the relevant theories of other specialties. The symbiosis theory mentioned\\nabove is a good choice.\\nIn the symbiosis theory, the way of interaction between the symbiotic units or the form of combination is known as\\nsymbiotic model, including four symbiotic behavior patterns - Parasitic, symbiotic partial benefit, mutual\\nnon-symmetrical symbiotic and mutually symbiotic symmetry and four symbiotic organization patterns - point\\nsymbiosis, intermittent symbiosis, continuous symbiosis and integration symbiosis.International Journal of Business and Management September, 2009\\n159\\nIt should be said that the ideal symbiotic model between the industries of macro-tourism is the combination of\\nmutually-beneficial symbiotic model with the integration symbiotic organizational model. The \\\"symmetric\\nmutually-beneficial symbiosis\\\" behavior pattern and \\\"the integration symbiosis\\\" organizational model are the ideal\\napproach to achieve Win - Win and Multi – win. “Symmetric mutually-beneficial symbiosis” is the basic direction and\\nfundamentals for the evolution of symbiotic system. The symmetric mutually-beneficial symbiosis state may reach\\nPareto optimal and meanwhile is the best incentive-compatible status or state of the best allocation of resources.\\n“Integration symbiosis” means that there are stable leading symbiotic interface and domination media between the\\nsymbiotic units so that the symbiont with independent nature and function is formed. The all-direction communication\\nand interaction ensures stable symbiotic relations.\\nNevertheless, it is pity that the symbiotic model among the industries of the macro-tourism in Nanjing is just at the\\nphase when the non -symmetrical mutually-beneficial symbiosis and the continuous symbiosis are combined. The\\ncombination of symmetrical mutually-beneficial symbiosis and the integration symbiosis should be the target for the\\ndevelopment of the industry of macro-tourism in Nanjing, which marks the real maturity of the industry.\\n4. How to Measure the Degree of Integration\\nThe symbiotic model between the industries of Nanjing macro-tourism is at the phase of non-symmetrical\\nmutually-beneficial symbiosis and continuous symbiosis.\\nAccording to the interactive relationship between the service industry and manufacturing industry and agriculture in\\nJiangsu province, we may infer that the interaction between the Nanjing tourist industry and the relevant industries is\\nnon-equilibrium and the integration of the industries of the macro-tourism is just at the beginning.\\nFrom Lyon Ti-fu matrix (table 1), we may find that whenever the final use is increased by 1 unit in the manufacturing\\nindustry, the influential factor on the demand for the same industry could be 2.692794 and that for service industry is\\njust 0.336495; whenever the final use is increased by 1 unit in agriculture, the influential factor on the demand for the\\nsame industry is 1.377853 while that for service industry is just 0.185153. Meanwhile, the influential factor of service\\nindustry on manufacturing industry, agriculture and the same industry is 0.592797, 0.110273 and 1.378234 respectively.\\nIt shows that the influence of the production of manufacturing industry, agriculture and service industry on the same\\nindustry is above the average level of impact on the entire society while the influence of one industry on the other two is\\nrelatively low. So we may conclude that the three industries are featured with internal cycle of high level but there is\\nlow association among the three industries (Yu Minghua 2007).\\nDue to the limit of statistical data, we may understand the service industry as tourist industry and take manufacturing\\nindustry and agriculture as the tourism-related industry. Generally such a qualitative conclusion can be reached that\\ntourist industry is interdependent on other related industries but such dependence is not balanced. The reliance of the\\nrelated industries on the tourist industry is relatively low (the comprehensive influential factor of manufacturing\\nindustry and agriculture on service industry is 0.521648) while the reliance of the tourist industry on the related\\nindustries is comparatively high (the comprehensive influential factor of service industry on manufacturing industry and\\nagriculture is 0.703070). It shows that the integration of tourist industry and the related industries are at an earlier phase\\nin the industrial chain. There is not a notable tendency for the integration of the tourist industry and the related\\nindustries.\\nInsert Table 1 here\\nThe table 2 shows that the direct consumption coefficient and the total consumption coefficient of tourist industry to the\\nmanufacturing industry are 0.001079 and 0.006643 respectively, ranking the 16th in the service industry (the author has\\ndoubts on the statistical standards applied here). The data proved the above conclusion from another side (Yang Xuan,\\n2006).\\nInsert Table 2 here\\n4.1 The Integration Mode between the Industries of Macro-tourism\\nIn the symbiosis of the macro-tourism industry, there is pervasiveness between the symbiotic units of tourism and new\\ntourist industry system can be formed by the wide integration with other industries. The tourism symbiotic units can be\\nembedded in the related industries and give the industries the tourism function and thus promoting the development of\\nthe related industries so as to form the symbiotic and win-win effect. Besides, we may search the relevant matching\\nintegrated unit among different industries with the tourism symbiotic unit as the center so as to form the tourist products\\nsatisfying the needs of tourist market and to realize the optimization and upgrading of the structure of tourist products\\n(Wang, Huimin, 2007). There are following types for the integration in the practice of tourist industry.\\n(1) Associative integration. The mutual integration between the tourist industry and other industries forms new format\\nof tourist industry and construct the compound new system of tourist industry and thus realizing the connection of the\\ntourist elements with other industries. Such integration forms integrative new industrial system by giving the originalVol. 4, No. 9 International Journal of Business and Management\\n160\\nindustry the new additional function and stronger competitiveness. When tourist function is integrated into industry,\\nagriculture and real estate, the new-type industrial format with mutual penetration to tourist industry is formed such as\\nindustrial tourism, agricultural tourism, landscape real estate and timeshare, sports tourism, cultural tourism and\\nrehabilitation tourism.\\n(2) Functional integration. In the regional social economic construction especially in the construction of key projects,\\nwe should integrate the tourist function consciously to realize the integrative development of tourist industry and\\nregional social economic construction. For instance, the TV tower in Shanghai – the Pearl of the Orient became the\\nsymbolic tourism landscape of Shanghai; The hundred of stores and 7 theme parks on the airport of Singapore enriches\\nthe local tourist products as well as upgrades the recreational function and reputation of infrastructure; the\\nNanjing-Hangzhou ecological expressway and Cross-sea bridge at Hanghzou bay recently completed are both\\nintegrated with the tourist function in the transport infrastructure.\\n(3) Structural integration. The reorganization integration between the elements within the tourist symbiotic units may\\nbring about the new multi-function tourist products through the mutual integration of tourist elements with various\\nfunctions. For instance, the Disneyland of Hong Kong jointly launched the low-price tour package of \\\"Hotel + Air +\\ntickets\\\" with United Airlines after integrating the hotels and amusement parks affiliated with it. Nanjing Sun Yetsen\\nMausoleum Scenic area enjoys a high reputation in the tourist market nationwide and possesses its resort hotels so it\\ncould have a try like Disneyland.\\n4.2 Strategy for the Development of Macro-Tourism Industry in Nanjing\\nThrough the above analysis, the author argues that “macro-tourism” is not only a slogan brought forward by Nanjing\\nMunicipal Government but also supported by deep connotations and broad industrial development theories.\\nMacro-tourism is basically characterized by comprehensiveness, openness and interaction. Therefore, we have to follow\\nits own rules in the course of developing the industry of macro-tourism in Nanjing.\\nFrom the perspective of tourism management system, we will further give play to the functions of Nanjing\\nTourism Steering Committee. Nanjing Tourism Bureau is in the dilemma of \\\"Big industries with small functions”. It is\\nnot easy for the bureau to undertake the major task of developing Nanjing’s macro-tourism industry. In this regard\\nShanghai has experience for Nanjing to follow. In 2007, Shanghai Government made the strategy of developing tourist\\nindustry: “Promote the industrial integration and form the macro-tourism economy typical of Shanghai. The proposition\\nand implementation of this strategy is based on the organizational form of Shanghai Tourism Management Committee\\nwho is led by the deputy mayor in charge of tourism and whose members include the person in charge of each\\ndepartment involved in the industry of macro-tourism. Such management system guarantees the implementation of the\\nstrategy of macro-tourism in Shanghai (Liu, Chen, 2007).\\nFrom the perspective of income from tourism, we shall increase the proportion of flexible tourist consumption in\\nthe total income of tourism. Among the six tourism elements, namely, food, housing, transportation, travel, shopping,\\nand entertainment, the first four rigid tourist consumption accounts for 70% of the total income from tourism in Nanjing\\nwhile the last two 30%. In contrast, shopping and entertainment accounts for 60% of the total income in Hong Kong\\nboasting of developed tourist industry. The contrast shows the low penetration of Nanjing tourism to relevant industries.\\nHowever, it also suggests the potential and future target of Nanjing tourism from another angle.\\nTo perfect Nanjing tourist product lines, strengthen the attraction of tourism and prolong tourists’ stay.In\\naddition to the traditional tourist products, we should make efforts to develop such products as business travel, holiday\\ntravel, sports travel, study travel, ecological travel and self-driving travel.\\nTo strengthen the industry integration, create new-style tourism format and promote the development of Nanjing\\ntourism economy.We should strengthen the integration of tourism with the relevant industries and vigorously develop\\nagriculture tourism, industrial tourism, education tourism, exhibition tourism and city park leisure tourism, etc. so as to\\npromote the social economic development of Nanjing with the framework of macro-tourism.\\nTo develop the industry of macro-tourism in Nanjing, we should strengthen the regional cooperation of different\\nlevels.Regional tourism cooperation is far from a fresh topic for Nanjing tourist industry. So far Nanjing has joined\\nsome regional tourism cooperation organization including the Nanjing-Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Tourist Area with Nanjing\\nas the center and the Yangtze River Delta tourism cooperation organization with members from some developed areas.\\nAmong them, the Nanjing-Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Tourist Area and Nanjing Metropolitan Area converge to some extent.\\nTo develop the industry of macro-tourism in Nanjing, we should pay special attention to exert the social benefits\\nof tourist industry. With cultural connotations and economic characteristics, tourist industry is a kind of cultural\\nindustry in a broad sense. As its focus on the unification of social, economic and ecological benefits, the industry of\\nmacro-tourism should consciously play its positive role in shaping the city image of Nanjing, enhancing the soft\\nstrength of the city, optimizing the investment environment, improving the life quality of Nanjing citizens and raising\\nthe public happiness index. The social benefits of tourist industry are reflected by its role as a bridge. “Tourism lays aInternational Journal of Business and Management September, 2009\\n161\\nfoundation for the business and trade”. For example, the Plum Flower Festival, Osmanthus Festival and Yangtze River\\nInternational Tourism Festival lay a sound foundation for the economic growth of Nanjing.\\nTo develop the industry of macro-tourism in Nanjing, we should strengthen the association between the tourism\\neconomy and the overall social –economic development of local region and serve the local economic development.\\nFor example, like the national macro economy, Nanjing regional economy is also confronted with a series of pressure\\nsuch as the urban-rural dual structure issue, inflation, the impact of RMB appreciation and employment pressure, etc. To\\nfollow and serve the local economic development with tourism, we should take advantage of the characteristics of\\ntourism when taking the macro economy into consideration. The specific measures include: developing agriculture\\ntourism, no arbitrary price hikes, properly encouraging the local residents for outbound tourism, actively attracting labor\\nemployment based on the labor-intensive feature of tourism.\\nIn short, to develop the macro-tourism in Nanjing, we should understand the tourist industry as a whole. We should take\\nthe composition of all the industries of tourism into full consideration and observe the development of the tourist\\nindustry from the perspective of big region, big market, big features and big coverage. We should develop the tourism\\nunder the concern and support of the whole society.\\n5. Conclusion\\nThe author has been pondering in the course of writing on such a question: why is the slogan of “macro-tourism”\\npresented as early as 13 years ago mentioned today? There could be three answers as follows: first, the presentation,\\ndevelopment and maturity of “macro-tourism” is going gradually; second, the model of “macro-tourism” is the natural\\nchoice for the development of China’s tourist industry; third, we used to understand “macro-tourism” as a single slogan\\nso our shallow academic research on it resulted in the practice failure.\\nThe paper offers a basic framework for the theoretical research on the industry of macro-tourism in Nanjing by\\nanalyzing the concept, connotations of macro-tourism and relations between its industries as well as the symbiotic\\nmodel and development path.\\nAcknowledgement\\nI would like to express my thanks to Feng Nianhua, Zhang Weiya, Tang Shu, Yu Shihai, Li Na, Dai Xinyi from the\\nTourism Management Department of Jinling Institute of Technology for their helps in my writing of the paper.\\nI would like to acknowledge the financial support received from Jiangsu Government Study Aboard scholarship for this\\nstudy.\\nReferences\\nLiu, Chen.
